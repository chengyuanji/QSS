## More visualization


We'll continue to analyze data from the STAR project, which is a four-year randomized trial on the effectiveness of small class sizes on education performance. The `star` data frame as been loaded into your space so that you can play around with it a bit.

### Boxplots

Boxplots are useful tools to visualize how the distribution of a continuous variable changes across levels of a categorical variable. There are several ways to specify a boxplot, but the most basic way to construct with tidyverse is as follow:

    ggplot(star, aes(y = cont.var, x = cat.var)) +
      geom_boxplot()

Here in the `ggplot` function, the first argument is name of the data frame that contains the two variables of interest, followed by `aes` to specify them on the boxplot. Most importantly, we want to specify the function `geom_boxplot` to produce a boxplot. Note that you can omit the `star` argument in the `ggplot` if you pass the data frame using the `%>%` operator.

#### Exercises

We can start by factorizing the `classtype` variable by using the `mutate` and the `as.factor` functions. Next, pass the expression to the `ggplot` function using the `%>%` operator. Include informative x-axis and y-axis labels with the  `labs` function. To fine tune the graph, we can use the `scale_x_discrete` function to give the class types more intuitive names. 

```{r boxplot, exercise = TRUE}
## factorize the variable `classtype`


## create a box plot with the characteristics specified in the instructions


```

```{r boxplot-solution}
star %>% 
  mutate(classtype = as.factor(classtype)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = classtype, y = g4math)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Math Scores", x = "Class Type") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Small class", "Regular class", "Regular class with aid"))
```

### Scatter plots

Now you'll think more about to measure bivariate relationships---that is, the relationship between two variables. The `ggplot` function takes the `data` argument followed by `aes` to specify the variable-of-interests, more importantly, specify `geom_point` to create a scatter plot as such: `ggplot(data, aes(x = variable, y = variable)) + geom_point()`. You will use this plot to explore the relationship between math and reading test scores in the `star` data.

#### Exercises
- Create a scatter plot using the `ggplot` and `geom_point` function with `g4math` on the x-axis and `g4reading` on the y-axis, both from the `star` data.

```{r scatter, exercise = TRUE}
## produce a scatterplot of g4math on the x-axis and g4reading on the y-axis

```

```{r scatter-solution}
## produce a scatterplot of g4math on the x-axis and g4reading on the y-axis
ggplot(star, aes(x = g4math, y = g4reading)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r scatter-check}
grade_code("OK, great plot! Let's make it a bit more polished.")
```


### Plotting two sets of points

Often we want to plot certain pints differently than others. For instance, maybe you want to see how the relationship between math and reading scores differs between students in small classes versus those not in small classes. To do this, we can subset the target classtypes with `filter` then specify colors of the different classtypes with `aes` within the `geom_point` function.

Before we do so, make sure to factorize the `classtype` variable for `ggplot` to create the graph.

#### Exercises

- Change the variable class of `classtype` to factor by using the `as.factor()` function
- Subset the data frame to only include Small class and Regular class for this scatter plot
- Pass the above expressions to the `ggplot` function using the `%>%` operator
- Differentiate data points from Small and Regular class by specifying `color` in the aes nested in `geom_point` 


```{r plot-points, exercise = TRUE}

```


```{r plot-points-solution}
## tidyverse
star %>% 
  mutate(classtype = as.factor(classtype)) %>%
  filter(classtype %in% c("1", "2")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = g4math, y = g4reading)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = classtype)) 
  
```

```{r plot-points-check}
grade_this_code()
```

### Finalizing your scatter plot

The scatter plot is looking very good, but it could use a little bit of polish. Let's add axis labels and a title. 

#### Exercises
- To do so, take the current plot and pass it to the `labs` function to make the graph more informative.

```{r niceplot, exercise = TRUE}

```

```{r niceplot-solution}
star %>% 
  mutate(classtype = as.factor(classtype)) %>%
  filter(classtype %in% c("1", "2")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = g4math, y = g4reading)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = classtype)) +
  labs(x = "Fourth Grade Math Scores", 
       y = "Fourth Grade Reading Score", 
       title = "Math vs Reading")
```
